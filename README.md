# Javascript-Matching-Game

This is a demonstration of how Javascript can create a card matching game.

In the html file, we have one div and that's it.  The cards are separate divs that are created and appended to the parent element in javascript.  Also, each card div contains two divs, the front and back of the card.  These denote the part the user clicks on so when applying css classes to the card itself, we will have to look at the parentNode (each element of an html page is a node) of the card we clicked on to get at the actual card div.

All styling is applied in Javascript as well.

The course that this comes from was a Javascript course, therefore, the style.css page is copied from the course resources and my own doing.
